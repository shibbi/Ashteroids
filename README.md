## Description
Ashteroids is a twist on the classic Asteroids game. Instead of spaceship shooting bullets at asteroids, you control Ash, who can throw Master Balls at Pikachu.

## Instructions
Control Ash with the arrow keys and fire Master Balls at Pikachu with the spacebar.
There can only be a maximum of five Master Balls in the game at any time.

## Current features
- Each Pikachu moves at a randomly generated velocity and direction
- Master Balls thrown moves in direction Ash is moving, but with faster velocity
- Custom images to replace circles drawn on canvas for Ash (ship), Master Balls (bullets), and Pikachu (asteroids)
- Custom sounds

## Planned features
- Lives for Ash
- Scores and leaderboard
- Levels
